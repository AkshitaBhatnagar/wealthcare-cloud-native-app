## Wealthcare Application

<img src="images/logo.png">

* Wealth Care is a wealth management company headquartered in Bangalore and rapidly expanded to all the major cities of India. It provides wealth management solutions to individuals in terms of financial plan creation and making investments. 
* It has been leveraging IT in a big way over the last decade and started their journey to cloud an year ago. They adopted lift and shift approach to move their apps to containers on Cloud initially. Recently they refactored their apps into micro-services and chosen Kubernetes open-standard as a container orchestration platform. 
* As the company is expanding their business rapidly, their demands from IT to match the business agility and speed are also increasing. The DevOps culture had to be adopted across the Organisation with small cross-functional teams working on micro-services development and deployment. The number of teams and the Kubernetes clusters have grown exponentially over a period of time and the management is losing control over the multiple environments spread across locations. 
* Also the IT leaders in the organisation have decided that they should not get locked into one Cloud environment. For their multiple needs across the Enterprise, they wanted to leverage multiple clouds in different locations. This has added a complexity in a different dimension altogether. All the streamlining of processes around Containerisation and DevOps seems to be falling apart with hybrid and multi-cloud demands in the Organization. 
* How would the IT team get visibility into the their apps and infrastructure in different Cloud environments? How could they automate the tasks of provisioning infrastructure, middleware and apps? How could they setup governance to ensure the security and compliance across all the environments? These are the challenges solved with Cloud Pak for Multi-Cloud Management from IBM. Let ºs see a demo around this scenario of Wealth Care company to understand more.
